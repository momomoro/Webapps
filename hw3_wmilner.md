### Committing your work (9/10)
  * **-1** Even though you have correctly added a .gitignore to your repository, the .gitignore does not remove files that are already committed. There is still a "__init__.pyc" and "settings.pyc" in your repository. To remove these files from your repo, you can use the `git rm [file]` command.

### Specification fulfillment (20/20)

### Validation (20/20)

### Routing and configuration (10/10)

### Coverage of technologies (30/40)
  * **-10** You should not store state of any previous button presses on the server. For this homework, any saved state should be returned to the client, usually as hidden fields in an HTML form.

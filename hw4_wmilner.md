### Committing your work (10/10)

### Specification fulfillment (19/20)
  * **-1** Posts should be displayed in reverse-chronological order (newest one first).

### Validation (18/20)
  * **-2** You should validate the length of the posted messages (posts can only be at most 160 characters each). This is important because some databases fail if the content exceeds the expected length constraint.
  * **-0** Regex strings should end with '$' if you want to designate that as the end of the url. For example, `r'^/' will match with *every* URL even if you don't intend that to be the case. We will begin to take points off for this in future assignments.

### Routing and configuration (10/10)

### Coverage of technologies (40/40)

### Design (0/0)
  * **-0** Your navbar shouldn't show `Login` as an option for logged-in users.
  * **-0** When you try to visit the profile of a non-existent user, it'll show an empty stream for them -- it might be better to indicate that the user doesn't exist.

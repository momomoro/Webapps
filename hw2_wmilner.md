### Committing your work (5/10)
    * **-5** Commit messages should adequately describe what occurs in your commits. For example, "Linked operation button with event handlers" rather than "added javascript".

### Specification fulfillment (28/30)
    * **-2** Display does not show a single integer value -specification required integer division, not floating point division.  

### Validation (6/10)
    * **-2** The JavaScript code crashes on the following input: 3 + + = (cannot recover from this sequence of button presses)
    * **-2** The JavaScript code crashes on the following input: 83 + - รท (cannot recover from this sequence of button presses)

### Coverage of technologies (50/50)
    * **-0** For some of your comparisons, you should consider using a === (triple equals). Triple equals do not return true if two "falsy" values are compared, making it a safer comparison. For example, the "0 == the empty string" would return true, but "0 === the empty string" would not.

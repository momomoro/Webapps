### Committing your work (20/20)

  * **-0** Make sure that your commit messages are actually accurate in describing what changes occurred in a commit. For example, your commit message '**css done**' in [this commit](https://github.com/CMU-Web-Application-Development/wmilner/commit/5cae3cfc3353a62b644796380b8288cf45a8c495) does not describe adequately what you accomplished in that commit. It's just sort of a broad statement  without details...

### Specification fulfillment (40/40)

### Coverage of technologies (40/40)

### Additional comments

  * **-0**, Avoid mixing tabs and spaces, resulting in uneven indentation when tabs are set to a different width (for example, GitHub uses 8 spaces per tab). One way to avoid would be to configure your editor to display whitespace so that you know what type is being used in your code.

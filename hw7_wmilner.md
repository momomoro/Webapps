### Specification fulfillment (20/20)

### Coverage of technologies (80/80)
  * **-10** (not fixed from HW5) Profiles with age/bio were not implemented, so adequate use of one-to-one relationships was not demonstrated.
  * **-40** The URL to your deployment is not in the README. Would have re-graded assignment if URL was provided, but received no response.

### Additional comments
